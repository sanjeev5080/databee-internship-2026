## Session 2 — March 28, 2026

**Attendees:** Suhash Raja, Filip Cedermark, Deepika Elangovan, Neha Doda, Kousalya (organizer), Sanjeev Kumar (mentor), Vivek Prasad (mentor), Vinod (mentor), Asindu Gayangana, Nikolaos Biniaris, Elliot Eriksson

**Agenda:**
1. Week check-in — what did you work on? Anything to share?
2. Platform — use and registration
3. Use cases defined per stream
4. Architectural discussion



**Notes:**

### 1. Week Check-in

Interns shared what they worked on since Session 1:

- **Suhash + group** — Reviewed the shared presentation slides; had a midweek check-in among themselves to compare tools and skills.
- **Filip Cedermark** — Refreshed SQL fundamentals on HackerRank (basic and advanced queries). Also attended a Snowflake AI/agentic event (got in last-minute via a colleague's spare spot).
- **Deepika Elangovan** — Recapped SQL basics; had not used SQL since joining Accenture, so focused on getting back up to speed with small queries.
- **Asindu Gayangana** — Worked on SQL and PySpark; focused on window functions and complex joins. Subscribed to a Spark Playground for hands-on practice.
- **Nikolaos Biniaris** — Practised SQL heavily (window functions, joins). Asked a good question: *how much do we need to manage clustering ourselves in Snowflake vs Databricks?* Sanjeev explained predictive optimization — both platforms can auto-manage clustering, but Databricks gives manual control if needed.
- **Elliot Eriksson** — Limited prior experience with data lifecycle; had done minor data cleaning projects (null/duplicate removal) including a cancer-identification ML project.

Sanjeev's advice to the group: attend platform meetups (Databricks, AWS, Microsoft, Snowflake) beyond big paid events — look up smaller user groups and meetups on meetup.com.

### 2. Platform — Use and Registration

Sanjeev walked through how to choose a platform to implement the use cases:

- All major cloud platforms offer free/trial accounts: **Azure (ADF)**, **AWS (Glue)**, **Databricks (Lakeflow Designer / Serverless SQL — now unlimited free tier)**, **Snowflake**.
- Recommended approach — start easy, then go deeper:
  - **Phase 1:** Drag-and-drop tools (ADF, Glue, Lakeflow Designer) — implement the use case with minimal code to understand the concepts.
  - **Phase 2:** Re-implement the same use case in **pure PySpark** — this is the target skill for data engineers.
- Failures/errors encountered along the way will surface important Spark internals worth discussing in sessions.
- **Task:** Each intern to pick a platform, spin up a trial account, and report back next session which platform they chose.

### 3. Architectural Discussion

#### 1. Data Lifecycle
The journey every piece of data takes through a modern data platform:

- **Ingestion** — Pull raw data from source systems (databases, APIs, flat files, streams) and land it as-is into storage (Bronze layer). No transformation yet.
- **Cleaning** — Remove nulls, duplicates, invalid records. Standardize formats (dates, currency, casing). This produces a trusted, queryable Silver layer.
- **Transformation** — Apply business logic: joins, aggregations, KPI calculations, data modelling (Star Schema). This is the Gold layer — ready for consumption. dbt owns this step.
- **Serving** — Expose the clean, modelled data to end consumers: dashboards (Power BI / Tableau), APIs, ML models, or self-serve querying (Databricks Genie).

#### 2. Distributed Systems
Why we can't just use a single machine for large data:

- A single machine has limits on CPU, RAM, and disk — at scale, data doesn't fit
- Distributed systems split work across many nodes (computers) that work in parallel
- Key concepts: partitioning (splitting data), fault tolerance (handling node failures), coordination (who does what)
- Examples in the wild: Hadoop (HDFS), Kafka (streaming), Cassandra (NoSQL), and the Spark cluster itself
- The trade-off: more complexity, but linear scalability

#### 3. Distributed Engines
The processing layer that runs on top of distributed systems:

- **Apache Spark / PySpark** — The dominant batch + streaming engine. Processes data in-memory across a cluster. Used for Silver → Gold transformations at scale.
- **Apache Flink** — Real-time stream processing. Lower latency than Spark Streaming.
- **Databricks** — Managed Spark platform with optimizations (Delta Engine, Photon). What most enterprises run today.
- **dbt** — Not distributed itself, but pushes transformation logic down into the warehouse engine (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) which is distributed underneath.

#### 4. File Formats
How data is physically stored on disk — this matters for performance:

| Format | Type | Pros | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSV | Row-based | Human readable, universal | Small files, quick sharing |
| JSON | Row-based | Flexible schema, API native | Raw ingestion, semi-structured data |
| Parquet | Columnar | Fast reads, great compression | Analytics, data warehouses |
| Avro | Row-based | Schema evolution, compact | Kafka streaming, Hadoop |
| Delta | Columnar + ACID | Versioning, time travel, ACID | Production pipelines (Databricks) |
| ORC | Columnar | Optimized for Hive/Hadoop | Legacy Hadoop stacks |

Key takeaway: **use Parquet or Delta for anything going into a pipeline**. CSV/JSON only at the ingestion boundary.

### 4. Use Cases Defined per Stream

Each intern now has a defined use case that will be their north star through the internship. These are end-to-end projects that build progressively each month.

**Sanjeev - DE**

**Use Case: Smart Retail Analytics & AI-Powered Recommendation Engine**

A retail company operates both online and offline stores. They receive raw data from multiple sources — transactional databases, REST APIs, and flat files — and need an end-to-end data platform to power business reporting, customer intelligence, and an AI-assisted product recommendation system.

**Data Sources:**
- Customer & Orders DB → PostgreSQL (OLTP) — ingested via Python + SQLAlchemy
- Product catalog → REST API (paginated JSON) — ingested via Python Requests
- Store inventory & suppliers → CSV files (daily drops) — processed via Pandas / PySpark
- User clickstream / behavior → JSON logs — processed via PySpark

**Pipeline Stages:**

- **Stage 1 — Extract (Bronze):** Ingest from all sources into cloud storage (S3/Azure Blob), partitioned by ingestion date. Raw data stored as-is.
- **Stage 2 — Silver (Cleaning & Enrichment):** Remove nulls, duplicates, invalid records. Standardize timestamps and currency. Join orders → customers → products. Deduplicate using SQL Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER). Use CTEs for readable transformation logic.
- **Stage 3 — Data Modeling:** Design a Star Schema (fact_orders + dim_customer, dim_product, dim_date, dim_store). Load into a cloud warehouse (Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift).
- **Stage 4 — Gold Layer with dbt:** Build dbt models for business metrics — revenue by product, customer lifetime value, customer segments (High/Mid/Low), store performance, inventory health. Add dbt tests (not_null, unique, custom SQL).
- **Stage 5 — Scale with PySpark:** Re-implement Silver → Gold transformations in PySpark. Handle millions of rows with partitioning, caching. Compare Pandas vs PySpark for scale.
- **Stage 6 — Orchestration with Airflow:** Daily DAG at 10 AM — extract → silver → gold → dbt run → notify. Add retry logic, failure alerts, backfill support, data quality sensor tasks.
- **Stage 7 — AI Layer (RAG + Vector DB):** Embed product descriptions → store in Pinecone or pgvector. Build a RAG pipeline for semantic product search and personalized recommendations using purchase history.
- **Stage 8 — CI/CD & Production Hardening:** GitHub Actions pipeline (lint → test → staging → prod). Environment-based dbt profiles. Bash scripts for health checks and backfills. Full documentation and architecture diagram.


**Approach 1 — Cloud Native:** Python → S3/Azure Blob → Snowflake/BigQuery → dbt → Airflow → pgvector/Pinecone → GitHub Actions

**Approach 2 — PySpark Stack:** Python + PySpark → Parquet/HDFS → PostgreSQL or Databricks → dbt → Airflow (local) → pgvector → GitHub Actions
