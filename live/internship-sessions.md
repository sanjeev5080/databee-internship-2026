### 1. Week Check-in

- **Filip Cedermark** — Screenshared Faker-based CDC generator: generates customer records (ID, name, email, phone, city, purchase amount) with configurable row count; first batch always change_type = "insert"; second function updates random rows → change_type = "update" or "delete"; includes nulls for DQ practice. Silver partly done: null email → "unknown@example.com", null phone → "not available". Next: move to dbt; implement quarantine/dead-letter table with reason tagging (Sanjeev recommendation). Will push code to GitHub.
- **Suhash Raja** — No major update this week.
- **Neha Doda** — Started SQL roadmap from GitHub; installed MS SQL Server 2019. Explored dbt and Databricks Academy fundamentals. Has prior Microsoft Fabric experience.
  → **Sanjeev**: Stay on DA track; dbt is the right tool — gives analysts power to do SQL-based transformations (equivalent of what DE does in PySpark). Switching to full DE from zero would be too steep right now. Discuss with Raj if wanting to change track.
- **Elliot Eriksson** — Demoed ML Use Case 1 (see section 2). Also working on Use Case 2. Dropped early.
- **Deepika Elangovan** — Limited progress (volunteering this week). Ingested data into bronze (customers + orders); silver: trimming, normalization, null removal, column renaming. Plans to add advanced functions before next session.
  → **Sanjeev task**: Research CI/CD artifact separation — what belongs in pipeline deployment (Databricks Bundles/API) vs infrastructure deployment (Terraform): specifically catalog, schema, and checkpoint artifacts. Prepare a pros/cons argument.
- **Asindu Gayangana** — No major update (busy last two weeks).
- **Nikolaos Biniaris** — Implemented SCDs, full DQ framework (4 checks: uniqueness, not-null, FK relationships, accepted values), quarantine table with reason column, and business metric APIs (CLV, revenue by product, holiday impact, customer segments, country performance). Detailed walkthrough in section 3.

---

### 2. Elliot — ML Use Case 1 Demo (Counter-Strike round winner predictor)

- **Data & preprocessing**: Game state features (time left, players alive per team, etc.); binary labels (win=1/loss=0); 80/20 train/test split
- **Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier; ROC AUC used for scoring
- **MLflow**: ~100 model runs via hyperparameter tuning; best model auto-selected. Accuracy improved from ~60% → ~80%
- **Sanjeev walkthrough of Databricks ML UI**: Showed Experiments + Models panel — all runs logged per iteration with metrics (precision, etc.); model can be registered and promoted; Serving section = deploy registered model to an endpoint for inference
- **Next steps for Elliot**: Explore MLflow in depth — model logging, feature stores, model serving. Also explore Snowflake Cortex (since now on Snowflake track).

---

### 3. Nikolaos — Pipeline Walkthrough & DQ Framework

Full pipeline: bronze → silver → dimensions → fact_sales → gold metrics → fact_sales_enriched (+ holidays API)

**DQ framework (modelled after dbt, without Great Expectations):**
- 4 checks: uniqueness of PKs, FK relationships, not-null on key columns, accepted values
- Single parameterized notebook — table name passed as job parameter; same notebook reused across all gold tables
- Quarantine table: broken rows with reason column (test type, failed count, pass rate)

**Sanjeev feedback:**
- Good reusable pattern; `.toPandas().toList()` for metadata table is fine for small metadata but flag as non-scalable if applied to data
- **Key next step — metadata-driven DQ framework**: Hardcoding column checks means every new table requires a code change → testing + deployment window + risk. Production standard: store check configs in a metadata table or JSON file → code reads config dynamically → no code change per new source onboarding
- **at-rest vs in-flight DQ**: current implementation reads data back after writing (at-rest). In-flight DQ (applied during write) is more efficient and lower latency. Research both; plan to migrate.

---

### 4. Technical Discussions

**infer schema vs fixed schema** (Suhash, Deepika, Asindu, Sanjeev):
- `inferSchema=True`: Spark samples a subset to auto-detect column types — risk of wrong inference (e.g., integer inferred but data later contains longs → truncation). Has happened in production.
- **Sanjeev's recommendation — mix and match**:
  - Give **schema hints** for critical columns (IDs, cost, dates) — Spark fixes those, infers the rest
  - In **bronze**: cast all columns to string (accepts everything, nothing dropped) + schema evolution enabled to capture new columns
  - In **silver+**: apply proper typed schema
  - Enable `mergeSchema=True` for schema evolution so new upstream columns are captured rather than silently dropped or failing the job
- **Asindu**: In bronze, schema inference + evolution is needed so new columns aren't lost for auditing. Sanjeev agreed but: risk of wrong type inference → prefer casting everything to string in bronze instead

**Scalar UDF vs Pandas (Vectorized) UDF** (Nikolaos, Suhash, Sanjeev):
- **Scalar UDF**: row-by-row; falls outside JVM → serialization/deserialization overhead; bypasses Catalyst optimizer. In some cases replacing a UDF with a native Spark function gives dramatic performance gains — this is one of the most common Spark optimization wins seen in production.
- **Pandas UDF**: chunk-based (processes batches of rows); stays within Spark execution model; significantly faster
- **Best practice**: Always prefer native Spark functions. Use UDF only when unavoidable. If unavoidable, use Pandas UDF.
- **When unavoidable**: custom ML inference per row (e.g., computer vision on IoT machine images — UDF fires model endpoint per image; switching to Pandas UDF → ~15K images processed in parallel per batch)
- UDFs unavoidable in ~20% of production cases; 80% can be replaced with native Spark functions

**AvailableNow trigger** (Asindu live demo, Sanjeev):
- `spark.readStream` polls source every 500ms by default — runs continuously
- `trigger(availableNow=True)`: converts streaming job to batch — reads all new files since last checkpoint, processes them in parallel, then stops. Checkpoint location handles incrementalization automatically.
- vs `spark.read` (batch): works fine but incrementalization must be handled manually (e.g., date-based directory structure + orchestrator passing current date)
- vs `trigger(once=True)` (deprecated): processes all data in a single batch — not parallel, inefficient for large datasets
- **Asindu's `maxBytesPerPartition` issue**: failing because source table is not partitioned — this option requires a partitioned source. To be covered in a dedicated Spark optimization session.
- Future sessions: dedicated deep-dive on rate limiting, `maxBytesPerTrigger`, `maxFilesPerTrigger`, partition pruning, and Spark optimization.

---

### 5. Logistics & Closing

- **Wednesday sync timing**: uncomfortable for several interns (Deepika: Swedish class; others joining late). To be resolved async via Slack.
- **Session stream split**: delayed due to logistics. Sanjeev handling all tracks for now; update coming via Slack.
- **Next session CANCELLED**: Sanjeev on business trip next weekend (returns Sunday evening). Session resumes in two weeks — **May 9**.

3. Deepika demo — CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker & Kubernetes *(carried over from Session 4)*
4. Architectural discussion — End-to-end data platform walkthrough *(Azure reference architecture)*
5. *(Carried over to next sessions)* Intern presentations — incrementalization, infer schema, AvailableNow trigger, UDFs; Elliot ML demo

**Notes:**

### 1. Week Check-in

- **Suhash Raja** — Connected Databricks to Azure ADLS using Azure Access Connector (managed identity service). Configured storage container access so Databricks reads ADLS automatically via Spark. Learned that Databricks creates a default Access Connector for Unity Catalog metadata — separate from the user-created one for data access. Sanjeev confirmed this distinction. Will also try connecting Databricks Community Edition (free tier) to ADLS.
- **Filip Cedermark** — Busy week (family matters), slightly behind. Switched to Faker for synthetic customer event data (fields: customer ID, name, email, phone, city, purchase amount, signup date). Planning to add CDC logic simulating email/city/order updates. Sanjeev asked Filip to share the Faker code with the group when ready so others can generate large-scale test data.
- **Deepika Elangovan** — Prepared CI/CD demo (presented in item 3). Working on Silver layer: removing nulls/duplicates, renaming columns. Plans to study window functions and Parquet vs Delta next. Sanjeev reminder: Silver is not done without data quality checks — add DQ before considering it complete.
- **Neha Doda** — Got onboarding guidance from Suhash and Filip during mid-week sync. Starting with SQL via the DA roadmap. Already holds Power BI PL-300 certification. Sanjeev directed her to the DA use case week-by-week plan in the repo.
- **Nikolaos Biniaris** — Implemented full CDC across bronze → silver → gold independently. Bronze: MERGE UPSERT by comparing primary key counts. Silver: watermark-based incremental inserts/updates. Gold: rebuilds dimensions/facts for new data. Raised and merged a PR to the main repo. Sanjeev: great example of the Git flow others should follow.
- **Elliot Eriksson** — Completed ML Use Case 1 in Databricks; needs to connect to GitHub and raise a PR. Watching Stanford ML lectures. Participating in a hackathon building a synthetic data model — plans to tie it into Use Case 2. Will demo if time permits.

---

### 2. Tech Platform Diversification

Sanjeev raised that the cohort is heavily Databricks + Azure focused and that **dbt** and **Snowflake** are widely used in the market with customer demand. Asked for volunteers:

- **Filip** → **dbt** (has prior internship experience with it; familiar with the concepts)
- **Elliot** → **Snowflake** (fully switching; had not progressed far in Databricks)

Others remain on Databricks and can add a second platform later. Sanjeev updated the tech platform table.

---

### 3. Deepika Demo — CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker & Kubernetes

**CI/CD overview:**
- CI/CD = Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or Deployment)
- Continuous Delivery = requires manual approval before production deploy
- Continuous Deployment = fully automated all the way to production
- Common practice: auto-deploy to dev/test/staging; manual gate for production

**GitHub Actions:**
- Pipeline config lives in `.github/workflows/` as YAML files
- Triggered on push or PR merge to a configured branch
- Steps: checkout code → set Python version → install dependencies → Docker login → Docker build → Docker push
- Secrets (Docker Hub token, API key) stored as GitHub Secrets — never hardcoded in code

**Docker:**
- Dockerfile layers: base image → set workdir → copy requirements → `pip install` → copy source code → expose port → run command
- Image tagging convention: `<date>.<run-number>` (e.g. `19.4.2026.6`) — human-readable vs default SHA hashes

**Kubernetes:**
- Rolling deployment: new pod is created and verified healthy before old pod is terminated → zero downtime
- Key concepts: pod (runs containers), service (exposes app), deployment (desired state config), node (VM), control plane (cluster management)
- Minikube used locally for demo (GitHub Actions does not support Minikube; it's a local learning tool only)

**Live demo app:** FastAPI Gothenburg Weather app using OpenWeather API (temperature, humidity, wind, 5-day forecast). Showed: Docker pull from Hub, `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`, rolling pod update in real time.

**Azure deployment path shown (not live):** Service principal + AKS cluster name + resource group configured as GitHub Secrets, then same YAML apply approach.

**Q&A highlights:**
- *Elliot:* When deploying new code, do you need to restart the running process? → *Sanjeev:* Yes, unless using blue-green deployment. *Deepika:* Kubernetes rolling deployment handles this — new pod runs before old pod is terminated.
- *Sanjeev:* How much of this applies to MLOps? → *Deepika:* Limited MLOps experience, couldn't fully answer. Same CICD principles apply but MLOps has model-specific concerns.

### 4. Architectural Discussion — End-to-End Data Platform

Sanjeev walked through a full Azure-based reference architecture of a typical customer data platform — framed as essential interview knowledge for all tracks (DE, DA, ML, DevOps).

**Sources:**
- RDBMS/DWH (SQL Server, Synapse) — JDBC connections, CDC streams
- Sensors & IoT (wind farms, electricity meters, factory machines, Electrolux fridges) — continuous real-time streams
- Files/Logs (JSON, XML, audit logs, cybersecurity logs) — semi-structured
- Media/Unstructured (images, video) — fed to ML models (e.g. Northvolt predictive maintenance)
- Business Apps — structured/aggregated; ML typically consumes at gold/feature store level
- Multi-cloud — common in enterprise; involves egress cost, networking, private links

**Ingest — Batch vs Streaming:**
- Batch: hours/daily cadence, lower cost
- Near real-time: seconds to minutes; Real-time: <1 second (fraud detection, card tap)
- Interview tip: always reason about *why* streaming is needed — cost tradeoff is real; every interviewer will probe this
- Tools: Azure Event Hub / Data Factory, Databricks Structured Streaming, Snowflake Snowpipes, AWS Kinesis

**Orchestration (spans all layers):**
- Manages job dependencies and scheduling end-to-end (ingest → transform → gold → reverse ETL)
- Tools: Databricks Workflows, Azure Data Factory, Apache Airflow, AWS Glue ETL

**Data & AI Governance:**
- Non-negotiable for enterprise production: row/column-level security, access control, lineage
- Databricks: Unity Catalog; Snowflake: Horizon; Azure: Purview; cross-platform: Immuta (referential catalog)
- For ML: AI governance — model access audit, EU AI Act compliance
- Sanjeev: *"Any platform without fine-grained access control will fail enterprise customers"*

**Operational DB & Reverse ETL:**
- Low-latency serving (<100ms): LakeBase (Databricks managed Postgres), Snowflake equivalent
- Reverse ETL: pushing aggregated gold data back to operational DBs for fraud detection, credit checks, in-app real-time dashboards

**Collaboration / Data Sharing:**
- Delta Share (Databricks), Snowflake Marketplace — share data with third parties without copying it

**DevOps across all layers:**
- DevOps/MLOps applies everywhere — CI/CD for code changes, IaC for infrastructure, MLOps for model lifecycle

**GDPR vs Data Governance:**
- Data Governance = who has access to data at rest right now (access control, lineage)
- GDPR = regulatory compliance (right to be forgotten, data residency) — related but distinct

## Session 4 — April 11, 2026

**Attendees:** Sanjeev Kumar (mentor), Elliot Eriksson, Suhash Raja, Deepika Elangovan, Nikolaos Biniaris, Asindu Gayangana

*Note: Filip not present.*

**Agenda:**

**Part 1 — Carried over from Session 3**
1. Week check-in — what did you work on? Blockers? Wins?
2. Parquet deep dive — why is it the backbone of big data?
3. Code sharing — Stage 1 progress; screen share what you have built so far
4. Architectural discussion — table formats (Delta, Iceberg, Hudi) deep dive and comparison; Lakehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Warehouse

   ![Data Intelligence Platform Architecture](../images/lakehouse-architecture.png)
5. ~~Deepika demo — CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions + Databricks~~ *(moved to Session 5 — PR raised, demo needs more prep)*

**Part 2 — Based on midweek sync (Apr 8)**
- Git workflow recap — quick walkthrough of feature branch → PR flow
- Data sources Q&A — clarify what datasets to use per stage (Faker, Kaggle, CoinGecko API, Raspberry Pi IoT simulator)
- ~~Catch up with Filip & Nikolaos — hear about their progress and see if there is anything the group can help with~~ *(Filip absent; Nikolaos covered in check-in)*

**Notes:**

### 1. Week Check-in

- **Elliot Eriksson** — Chose Databricks as ML platform. Currently working on a simple supervised learning project to learn how Databricks works. Has Git set up but hasn't pushed code yet — waiting until something is complete.
- **Suhash Raja** — Studied window functions and CTEs. Attempted to set up source data but hit connectivity issues between local machine and Azure. Exploring Kafka + Kubernetes → Databricks as a pipeline topology. Sanjeev flagged to not stay stuck — ask for help early. Will set up Git repo.
- **Deepika Elangovan** — Set up Databricks platform. Generated synthetic data using Faker (orders.csv + customers.csv, ~5,000 rows). Uploaded to Databricks and read using PySpark. Studied Spark architecture, DAG, lazy evaluation, DataFrames, and ELT vs ETL hybrids. Raised a PR for CI/CD work (used fork method instead of direct clone — Sanjeev confirmed both approaches are fine). Will demo CI/CD next session.
- **Nikolaos Biniaris** — Joined CSV sources and enriched with API data. Initially used a weather API for order enrichment but hit rate limits (~900 records/day cap). Switched to a **Public Holidays API** to enrich orders by country — goal is to analyse whether sales correlate with public holidays. Screen-shared pipeline showing parallel ingestion (CSV + API) and Silver join on the date column.
- **Asindu Gayangana** — Parameterized pipeline scripts using Databricks task parameters passed into notebooks. Created a DIM_DATE table directly to Silver (skipped Bronze — justified as a one-time static load). For other sources, used AutoLoader (`readStream` + `cloudFiles`) with schema inference, schema evolution mode, `maxFilesPerTrigger`, and CDC. Screen-shared code. Had a detailed discussion on incrementalization, infer schema, and the AvailableNow trigger (see section 3).

---

### 2. Parquet Deep Dive

Group discussion — interns shared what they researched:

- **Suhash** — Columnar format stores data column-by-column rather than row-by-row. Since values in a column share the same type, compression is very efficient. Only selected columns are read — not the entire row.
- **Nikolaos** — Validated the column pruning behaviour: selecting 2 of 20 columns reads only those 2 columns; the other 18 are skipped entirely by the engine. This can reduce query time from hours to seconds at scale.
- **Asindu** — Added that Parquet is OLAP-optimised. Per-column compression is more effective because each column has a uniform data type. Parquet also stores min/max statistics per column chunk, enabling predicate pushdown and file pruning without reading the data itself.

**Sanjeev expanded:**
- Parquet compression algorithms (Snappy, ZSTD) can compress data 10x or more — a file that is 100 MB on disk could expand to 10 GB in memory.
- In contrast, CSV/text compression is far less efficient because data types are mixed per row.
- **Open table formats (Delta, Iceberg, Hudi)** are not new file formats — they are Parquet underneath, but with an additional **metadata layer** (JSON/Avro sidecar files) that stores: min/max statistics per column, deletion vectors, schema versions, and partition metadata.
- When a query runs against a 1 TB table split across 10,000 Parquet files, the metadata layer allows **data skipping** — the engine reads the metadata first and prunes irrelevant files before touching any data files.
- **Task for next session:** Research what specific problems Delta/Iceberg/Hudi solve that raw Parquet cannot handle on its own.

---

### 3. Code Screen Shares & Technical Discussion

**Nikolaos — API Ingestion & Parallel Pipeline**
- Ingesting CSV and Public Holidays API in parallel Databricks tasks.
- Silver layer joins the two sources on the date column to enrich orders with holiday flags.
- Hit weather API rate limits earlier — good real-world lesson on API ingestion design.
- **Sanjeev's advice on API ingestion in interviews:** Be able to articulate that API ingestion is viable but comes with trade-offs — rate limits, scalability (will the API handle a 10x increase in calls?), and whether batch pull vs event-driven push is the right model.
- **Spark UDFs vs pure Python for APIs:** Nikolaos correctly avoided Spark UDFs for API calls. Key reasons: UDFs fall outside the JVM and lose Catalyst optimiser benefits; they are row-by-row unless vectorized; serialisation/deserialisation overhead.
- **Sanjeev assigned research:** Compare **scalar UDF** vs **vectorized UDF (Pandas UDF)** — why the vectorised variant is faster and when each should be used.

**Asindu — Parameterized AutoLoader Pipeline**
- Task parameters passed from Databricks Workflow into notebook widgets — good production pattern for reusability.
- DIM_DATE created directly to Silver without Bronze — valid for one-time static reference tables.
- For transactional sources, used AutoLoader (`readStream + cloudFiles`) with:
  - `inferSchema = true` — auto-detects column types; if disabled, everything reads as string.
  - `schemaEvolutionMode` — handles upstream schema changes without failing the job.
  - `maxFilesPerTrigger` — limits how many files are processed per micro-batch (scalability control).
- **Sanjeev's questions (to research for next session):**
  - `inferSchema true` vs manually defining a fixed schema — what production problems can each cause?
  - `AvailableNow` trigger — Asindu's explanation was partially correct; Sanjeev clarified: if you use `readStream`, the job would normally run continuously (24/7). `AvailableNow` tells the streaming API to process all available data *now* and then stop — making a streaming job behave like a scheduled batch job.
- AutoLoader handles idempotency automatically via checkpoint locations — it tracks which files have already been processed and only ingests new arrivals.
- **Sanjeev noted:** Even without AutoLoader, incrementalization can be achieved using batch APIs — interns should understand both approaches.

**General points raised by Sanjeev:**
- All interns should push code to Git using the **feature branch → PR** workflow. Treat the internship repo like a production delivery to a customer.
- Asindu's Git invite had expired — Sanjeev to re-add.
- Session time of 1 hour is proving short given the screen-sharing depth. Sanjeev will discuss extending sessions with Kousalya.

---

### 4. Architectural Discussion — Lakehouse Introduction *(partial)*

- **Deepika** summarised: Data Warehouse holds processed/structured data; Data Lake holds raw + semi-structured data; Lakehouse is a combination of both for advanced analytics.
- **Sanjeev** began the evolution narrative: started with traditional Data Warehouses (Oracle, SQL Server) → limitations led to the Data Lake concept → *(transcript cut off here)*
- The group discussed the key differences between the three paradigms — Data Warehouse, Data Lake, and Lakehouse — and how the Lakehouse addresses the weaknesses of both predecessors.
- Discussion touched on how the Lakehouse architecture is **scalable** (built on object stores like S3/ADLS, compute and storage scale independently) and **ACID compliant** (enabled by open table formats like Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi, which bring transactional guarantees on top of Parquet). *(Full discussion not captured in transcript — to be continued in Session 5.)*

## Session 3 — April 4, 2026

**Attendees:** Sanjeev Kumar (mentor), Kousalya (organizer), Suhash Raja, Filip Cedermark, Asindu Gayangana, Elliot Eriksson, Deepika Elangovan, Nikolaos Biniaris

*Note: Easter weekend — some interns had limited availability; Filip left early.*

**Agenda:**
1. Repo walkthrough — structure, CLAUDE.md, branching strategy
2. Week check-in & platform check-in
3. Use case progress & live demos
4. Architectural discussion — file formats & table formats

**Notes:**

### 1. Repo Walkthrough

Sanjeev walked through the repo structure for interns who had just cloned it:

- `raw/` — raw inputs including meeting transcripts. Interns can commit their own midweek sync transcripts here as a progress tracker.
- `live/` — living documents (session notes, use cases, topics list). All interns have read/write access; suggest edits via PRs.
- `action/` — intern work artifacts. Each intern creates their own subfolder under their stream (e.g. `action/DE-DevOps/your-name/`). Treat it as a monorepo.
- `CLAUDE.md` — key config file for AI-assisted workflows. Changes should go through PRs, not direct commits to main.
- Branching strategy: `feature/*` → `dev` → `staging` → `main` (GitFlow lite). All interns should create feature branches and submit PRs.

### 2. Week Check-in & Platform Check-in

- **Suhash Raja** — Started SQL basics (DDL) in Databricks. Chose **Databricks** (free enterprise edition). Has not cloned the repo yet; plans to do so post-session.
- **Filip Cedermark** — Getting set up on Databricks; file structure setup was trickier than expected. Used ChatGPT to generate sample data and landed it in Databricks. Planning to look at Stage 2 (CDC) next. Sanjeev recommended switching to the **Faker library** for reusable, scalable data generation in Databricks.
- **Asindu Gayangana** — Built a pipeline in Databricks using a 5M-row Kaggle dataset. Used **Autoloader** for Bronze ingestion. Set up **Change Data Feed (CDF)** on the Bronze table — manually modified data via SQL, then extracted changed records using version history (max version). Loaded dimension tables; still needs to join the fact table for Silver. Also researched Spark internals: worker nodes, partitions, ideal partition sizes, on-heap memory (execution + storage). Could not fully understand off-heap memory.
- **Elliot Eriksson** — Read about Spark and PySpark; drew diagrams of how it works. Confirmed he's on the **ML track**. Planning to use VS Code + PySpark. Sanjeev pointed out ML platform options: Databricks (MLflow), Snowflake (Cortex), AWS (SageMaker), Azure ML.
- **Deepika Elangovan** — Created Databricks account (Azure free trial exhausted). Watching YouTube tutorials on data ingestion. Has an existing GitHub CI/CD repo. Sanjeev asked her to demo CI/CD pipeline to the group using GitHub Actions + Databricks integration. Also mentioned **Databricks Asset Bundles** and **Terraform** as tools to explore.
- **Nikolaos Biniaris** — Shared screen showing Databricks. Ingested CRM/ERP data (customers, products, sales + dimension data — 6 tables) using both Python and SQL notebooks. Chose not to partition at Bronze (no date columns; dates stored as strings). Researched partitioning in Databricks vs standard Spark. Asked about handling multiple source types (CSV + API) — Sanjeev showed how to build parallel Databricks workflow tasks for independent sources. Also asked about API ingestion; Sanjeev directed him to research **Spark UDFs** and their trade-offs.

### 3. Architectural Discussion — File Formats & Table Formats

**Structured vs Semi-structured vs Unstructured data:**
- **Unstructured** (images, binary blobs) — no schema, slowest to process.
- **Semi-structured** (JSON, XML) — schema loosely coupled (xsd for XML); can be processed without schema.
- **Structured** (tabular, Parquet, Delta) — schema tightly bound; fastest for engines to process.

**Open Source vs Proprietary formats:**
- Proprietary: Oracle, Teradata, Snowflake's internal formats — require licenses.
- OSS: Parquet, Delta, Iceberg, Hudi, Avro, ORC — free to use; any engine or platform can adopt them.
- Interview tip: being able to reference OSS technologies (Apache Spark, MLflow, Iceberg) rather than only vendor tools shows platform-agnostic depth.

**Object stores:** S3, ADLS, GCS — where all data lives as files (called "objects"). Bronze/Silver/Gold data all lives here.

**Parquet:**
- The bread and butter of the big data world. Columnar format. Foundation of almost every modern data platform.
- **Task for interns:** research *why* Parquet is so important and what problem it solves. Discuss in midweek sync.

**Open Table Formats — Delta, Iceberg, Hudi:**
- All three are built on top of Parquet but add a metadata layer.
- Key features added: ACID transactions, time travel, schema enforcement, versioning, upsert/merge support.
- Delta Lake: created by Databricks engineers, then open sourced. Liquid clustering is a Delta innovation, also open sourced.
- Iceberg and Hudi: alternative open table formats with similar capabilities.
- Discussion to continue next session with deeper comparison.

**Streaming source tip (for Suhash's question):**
- **Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Web Simulator** — free, browser-based tool that generates IoT data and writes to Azure IoT Hub. Can be pointed at Databricks Structured Streaming or ADF for practice with real streaming ingestion.

## Session 2 — March 28, 2026

**Attendees:** Suhash Raja, Filip Cedermark, Deepika Elangovan, Neha Doda, Kousalya (organizer), Sanjeev Kumar (mentor), Vivek Prasad (mentor), Vinod (mentor), Asindu Gayangana, Nikolaos Biniaris, Elliot Eriksson

**Agenda:**
1. Week check-in — what did you work on? Anything to share?
2. Platform — use and registration
3. Use cases defined per stream
4. Architectural discussion



**Notes:**

### 1. Week Check-in

Interns shared what they worked on since Session 1:

- **Suhash + group** — Reviewed the shared presentation slides; had a midweek check-in among themselves to compare tools and skills.
- **Filip Cedermark** — Refreshed SQL fundamentals on HackerRank (basic and advanced queries). Also attended a Snowflake AI/agentic event (got in last-minute via a colleague's spare spot).
- **Deepika Elangovan** — Recapped SQL basics; had not used SQL since joining Accenture, so focused on getting back up to speed with small queries.
- **Asindu Gayangana** — Worked on SQL and PySpark; focused on window functions and complex joins. Subscribed to a Spark Playground for hands-on practice.
- **Nikolaos Biniaris** — Practised SQL heavily (window functions, joins). Asked a good question: *how much do we need to manage clustering ourselves in Snowflake vs Databricks?* Sanjeev explained predictive optimization — both platforms can auto-manage clustering, but Databricks gives manual control if needed.
- **Elliot Eriksson** — Limited prior experience with data lifecycle; had done minor data cleaning projects (null/duplicate removal) including a cancer-identification ML project.

Sanjeev's advice to the group: attend platform meetups (Databricks, AWS, Microsoft, Snowflake) beyond big paid events — look up smaller user groups and meetups on meetup.com.

---

### 2. Platform — Use and Registration

Sanjeev walked through how to choose a platform to implement the use cases:

- All major cloud platforms offer free/trial accounts: **Azure (ADF)**, **AWS (Glue)**, **Databricks (Lakeflow Designer / Serverless SQL — now unlimited free tier)**, **Snowflake**.
- Recommended approach — start easy, then go deeper:
  - **Phase 1:** Drag-and-drop tools (ADF, Glue, Lakeflow Designer) — implement the use case with minimal code to understand the concepts.
  - **Phase 2:** Re-implement the same use case in **pure PySpark** — this is the target skill for data engineers.
- Failures/errors encountered along the way will surface important Spark internals worth discussing in sessions.
- **Task:** Each intern to pick a platform, spin up a trial account, and report back next session which platform they chose.

### 3. Architectural Discussion

#### 1. Data Lifecycle
The journey every piece of data takes through a modern data platform:

- **Ingestion** — Pull raw data from source systems (databases, APIs, flat files, streams) and land it as-is into storage (Bronze layer). No transformation yet.
- **Cleaning** — Remove nulls, duplicates, invalid records. Standardize formats (dates, currency, casing). This produces a trusted, queryable Silver layer.
- **Transformation** — Apply business logic: joins, aggregations, KPI calculations, data modelling (Star Schema). This is the Gold layer — ready for consumption. dbt owns this step.
- **Serving** — Expose the clean, modelled data to end consumers: dashboards (Power BI / Tableau), APIs, ML models, or self-serve querying (Databricks Genie).

#### 2. Distributed Systems
Why we can't just use a single machine for large data:

- A single machine has limits on CPU, RAM, and disk — at scale, data doesn't fit
- Distributed systems split work across many nodes (computers) that work in parallel
- Key concepts: partitioning (splitting data), fault tolerance (handling node failures), coordination (who does what)
- Examples in the wild: Hadoop (HDFS), Kafka (streaming), Cassandra (NoSQL), and the Spark cluster itself
- The trade-off: more complexity, but linear scalability

#### 3. Distributed Engines
The processing layer that runs on top of distributed systems:

- **Apache Spark / PySpark** — The dominant batch + streaming engine. Processes data in-memory across a cluster. Used for Silver → Gold transformations at scale.
- **Apache Flink** — Real-time stream processing. Lower latency than Spark Streaming.
- **Databricks** — Managed Spark platform with optimizations (Delta Engine, Photon). What most enterprises run today.
- **dbt** — Not distributed itself, but pushes transformation logic down into the warehouse engine (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) which is distributed underneath.

#### 4. File Formats
How data is physically stored on disk — this matters for performance:

| Format | Type | Pros | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSV | Row-based | Human readable, universal | Small files, quick sharing |
| JSON | Row-based | Flexible schema, API native | Raw ingestion, semi-structured data |
| Parquet | Columnar | Fast reads, great compression | Analytics, data warehouses |
| Avro | Row-based | Schema evolution, compact | Kafka streaming, Hadoop |
| Delta | Columnar + ACID | Versioning, time travel, ACID | Production pipelines (Databricks) |
| ORC | Columnar | Optimized for Hive/Hadoop | Legacy Hadoop stacks |

Key takeaway: **use Parquet or Delta for anything going into a pipeline**. CSV/JSON only at the ingestion boundary.

### 4. Use Cases Defined per Stream

Each intern now has a defined use case that will be their north star through the internship. These are end-to-end projects that build progressively each month.

**Sanjeev - DE**

**Use Case: Smart Retail Analytics & AI-Powered Recommendation Engine**

A retail company operates both online and offline stores. They receive raw data from multiple sources — transactional databases, REST APIs, and flat files — and need an end-to-end data platform to power business reporting, customer intelligence, and an AI-assisted product recommendation system.

**Data Sources:**
- Customer & Orders DB → PostgreSQL (OLTP) — ingested via Python + SQLAlchemy
- Product catalog → REST API (paginated JSON) — ingested via Python Requests
- Store inventory & suppliers → CSV files (daily drops) — processed via Pandas / PySpark
- User clickstream / behavior → JSON logs — processed via PySpark

**Pipeline Stages:**

- **Stage 1 — Extract (Bronze):** Ingest from all sources into cloud storage (S3/Azure Blob), partitioned by ingestion date. Raw data stored as-is.
- **Stage 2 — Silver (Cleaning & Enrichment):** Remove nulls, duplicates, invalid records. Standardize timestamps and currency. Join orders → customers → products. Deduplicate using SQL Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER). Use CTEs for readable transformation logic.
- **Stage 3 — Data Modeling:** Design a Star Schema (fact_orders + dim_customer, dim_product, dim_date, dim_store). Load into a cloud warehouse (Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift).
- **Stage 4 — Gold Layer with dbt:** Build dbt models for business metrics — revenue by product, customer lifetime value, customer segments (High/Mid/Low), store performance, inventory health. Add dbt tests (not_null, unique, custom SQL).
- **Stage 5 — Scale with PySpark:** Re-implement Silver → Gold transformations in PySpark. Handle millions of rows with partitioning, caching. Compare Pandas vs PySpark for scale.
- **Stage 6 — Orchestration with Airflow:** Daily DAG at 10 AM — extract → silver → gold → dbt run → notify. Add retry logic, failure alerts, backfill support, data quality sensor tasks.
- **Stage 7 — AI Layer (RAG + Vector DB):** Embed product descriptions → store in Pinecone or pgvector. Build a RAG pipeline for semantic product search and personalized recommendations using purchase history.
- **Stage 8 — CI/CD & Production Hardening:** GitHub Actions pipeline (lint → test → staging → prod). Environment-based dbt profiles. Bash scripts for health checks and backfills. Full documentation and architecture diagram.


**Approach 1 — Cloud Native:** Python → S3/Azure Blob → Snowflake/BigQuery → dbt → Airflow → pgvector/Pinecone → GitHub Actions

**Approach 2 — PySpark Stack:** Python + PySpark → Parquet/HDFS → PostgreSQL or Databricks → dbt → Airflow (local) → pgvector → GitHub Actions
